## Rails Message Board

A simple message board with image upload support.

Currently in **Beta** status: 

* Only logged in users can create messages
* Messages can only be edited or destroyed by the message owner
* User registration works out of the box, but the email service must be configured apart in prod for the users to receive the activation email
* Subthreads are not developed yet

## Requirements

* Requires Rails 5.1.1 + Ruby 2.3 or higher

* See the Gemfile for system dependencies

* Test suite is executed just by running `rails test` at the project folder
